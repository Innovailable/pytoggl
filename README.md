# pytoggl

`pytoggl` attempts to provide a simple Python 3 wrapper for the (Toggl
API)[https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs].

The developement will be driven by a specific use case (a tray icon app). The
goal is to provide a high-level abstraction for the complete API, but
functionality exceeding the use case might not be developed immediately. If you
are interested in using this library feel free to contact me with requests or
extend the code yourself.
